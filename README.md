## Property sheet demo (monolithic)

This project demonstrates how you might use a single, big (= monolithic) property sheet file to encapsulate your compiler and linker configuration, abstracting those away from individual project files.

Using this approach, it becomes much easier to easily tweak the configuration of many projects in one place, since you only need to change the one file, and all projects that import it get changed automagically.
